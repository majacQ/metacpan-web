        In December 2019, several MetaCPAN developers came together in Toronto
        for an invite-only intensive workshop, dubbed meta::hack v4, to do
        focused maintenance and feature work on MetaCPAN.

<a href="https://cpanel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cPanel</a> is a web-based control panel for managing a web hosting account. It provides a simple yet powerful interface for managing email accounts, security, domains, databases, and more. cPanel was originally written (in Perl!) by Nick Koston in 1997. cPanel (the company) now employees over 200 people, and Nick is their CEO. They've been using Perl for nearly 20 years now, and have long been supporters of Perl and its community. You may recognise some of their developers who are CPAN authors: Todd Rinaldo (<a href="https://metacpan.org/author/TODDR">TODDR</a>), Xan Hilmisd√≥ttir (<a href="https://metacpan.org/author/XAN">XAN</a>), and others. Their CEO, Nick, still develops in Perl today.
